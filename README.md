This repo contains my esp projects.

the Blinkman project Blinks the onboard LED in the NodeMCU ESP32WROOM32 board, found on the AZ-Delivery (Though I procured the board from robu.in in india, and it doesnt contain any etching on the heat spreader as on the AZ-Delivery boards, my guess its a cheap knockoff of the original ESP32WROOM32, yet identical). The entire code is kept as baremetal as possible, under the esp32 bootloader config.

Get-Started is the example project directory supplied by esp-idf.
